# Installation Requirements and Guide

[If you already have NodeJS and npm as well as MongoDB installed on your machine](#have-nodejs-and-mongodb)

[If you don’t have NodeJS and npm but do have MongoDB](#no-node-but-have-mongodb)

[If you do have NodeJS and npm but not MongoDB](#no-mongodb-but-have-node)

[If you don’t have either](#neither)



## Have Nodejs and Mongodb
After downloading the resources from the git repo

In your command line interface navigate to the folder containing all the files the path should look something like this:


### First
* To install all the required dependencies from the package.json run:
* npm install
### After
* run the following command to start the server
* node main.js



With this, a link to the host of 127.0.0.1 and port 3000 (unless your environment specifies a port) will start up the page.

Now you will load up with an empty canvas and you can add to it all you want! You can also see the update across multiple other clients that you have on your local instance!
